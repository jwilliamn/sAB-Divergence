### Introduction

> We study here a variational objective to simultaneously trade off effects of mass-covering,spread and outlier robustness.  This is done by developing a variational inference objectiveusing the alpha-beta (AB) divergence, a family of divergence governed by two parametersand covering many of the divergences already used for VI as special cases.


### Main task:

Alpha-Beta divergence is investigated and compared with respect to other wellknown divergences in literature.

### Results:
